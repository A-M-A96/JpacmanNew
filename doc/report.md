# Software Quality & Testing Report

## Assignment 0

### Question 0.3

The reason why we can not exhaustively test our entire software project is because even if it does not include many branches, inputs and outputs, it would be realistically impossible to test all possible combinations of input values. Instead we should for example prioritise the combinations of values that are most common or that are most likely to cause faults.

### Question 0.4

The pesticide paradox says that like a pesticide, testing only gets rid of those bugs that the test cases cover. The consequence of this paradox is that once you have run the same tests over and over again, no new information can be derived as no new bugs will be found. In addition, more subtle bugs will not be detected by these tests. This implies for software testers that we have to constantly write new test cases as we cannot depend on old test cases made a long time ago to find new bugs.

### Question 0.5

We should automate the test execution process as much as possible because this is the part of the testing process that depends least on human input, is prone to human error, is rather monotonous and thus lends itself best to automation.
